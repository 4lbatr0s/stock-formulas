## STRUCTURE
2. Scrap the values from a single or multiple websites.
4. You can put a SortingValues property to each stockValue object and do sortings based on these values, for instance AAPL:{SortingValues: {graham:5, ebitda:241, ...., p/b:123}}
 
## CODE
1. Create a global logger middleware.
3. CREATE A SINGLE REDIS CLIENT, DO NOT CALL REDISCONFIG EVERWHERE. USE THE SAME CLIENT EVERYWHERE. THIS IS A PROBLEM ORIGINATE FROM EXPORTING AN ASYNCHRONOUS FUNCTION IN configs/caching/redis.js file.
4. TRY TO USE REDIS BY PASSING IT FROM BaseController to the inherited controllers.
5. REDIS EXPIRATION DOES NOT WORK, PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE REASON ABOVE: ITS NOT WORKING BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU EXECUTE THE FUNCTION, ITS A NEW REDIS CLIENT, SO EXPIRATION DATES DISAPPEAR INTO THE SPACE :)
6. CATCH BLOCKS IN THE SERVICES DOES NOT NEED TO HAVE NEXT, THEY JUST NEED TO THROW EXCEPTIONS!

## IDEAS:
- A USER SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE SORTING OPTIONS. FOR INSTANCE, A USER MIGHT WANT TO SORT STOCKS BASE OF OVERALL EVALUATION OF FOUR DIFFERENT STOCK CHOOSING STRATEGIES.
-- USER CHOOSES GRAHAM NUMBER, EBITDA ..2 MORE AND WE ONLY RETURN THE OVERALL EVALUATION OF FOUR DIFFERENT STOCK CHOOSING STRATEGIES.

### GRAHAM VALUE
- BRING STOCK INFO WITH GRAHAM VALUE.
- BRING MAXIMUM PRICE YOU SHOULD PAY FOR THE STOCK
- BRING ATTRACTIVE, AVOID.
