## STRUCTURE
1. Decide required parameters for every value that will be calculated.
2. Scrap the values from a single or multiple websites.
3. Calculate the values
4. You can put a SortingValues property to each stockValue object and do sortings based on these values, for instance AAPL:{SortingValues: {graham:5, ebitda:241, ...., p/b:123}}
 
## CODE
1. Create a global logger middleware.
2. Use REDIS to cache the api responses.[DONE]
3. CREATE A SINGLE REDIS CLIENT, DO NOT CALL REDISCONFIG EVERWHERE. USE THE SAME CLIENT EVERYWHERE. THIS IS A PROBLEM ORIGINATE FROM EXPORTING AN ASYNCHRONOUS FUNCTION IN configs/caching/redis.js file.
4. TRY TO USE REDIS BY PASSING IT FROM BaseController to the inherited controllers.
5. REDIS EXPIRATION DOES NOT WORK, PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE REASON ABOVE: ITS NOT WORKING BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU EXECUTE THE FUNCTION, ITS A NEW REDIS CLIENT, SO EXPIRATION DATES DISAPPEAR INTO THE SPACE :)
6. CATCH BLOCKS IN THE SERVICES DOES NOT NEED TO HAVE NEXT, THEY JUST NEED TO THROW EXCEPTIONS!

## IDEAS:
- A USER SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE SORTING OPTIONS. FOR INSTANCE, A USER MIGHT WANT TO SORT STOCKS BASE OF OVERALL EVALUATION OF FOUR DIFFERENT STOCK CHOOSING STRATEGIES.
-- USER CHOOSES GRAHAM NUMBER, EBITDA ..2 MORE AND WE ONLY RETURN THE OVERALL EVALUATION OF FOUR DIFFERENT STOCK CHOOSING STRATEGIES.

### GRAHAM VALUE
- BRING STOCK INFO WITH GRAHAM VALUE.
- BRING MAXIMUM PRICE YOU SHOULD PAY FOR THE STOCK
- BRING ATTRACTIVE, AVOID.

### HOW TO CALCULATE EBITDA'S:
EBITDA:  25 SECONDS, 
-SEND REQUESTS PER EVERY 1.5 SECONDS, UNTIL YOU'VE SENT REQUESTS PER EVERY STOCK SYMBOL.
-MULTITHREADING? 
-SAVE THEM TO REDIS.
-THEN AFTER 20 MINUTES RE-DO.
-MAKE EXPIRE TIME 15 MINUTES, SO WHILE UPDATING YOUR VALUES IN THE REDIS PER EVERY 15 MINUTES, YOU WILL STILL BE ABLE TO REACH VALUES.


# PROBLEMS

1. Price to Sales, Debt to Equities, Return on Equity values cannot be calculated because required parameters are not in the json!
