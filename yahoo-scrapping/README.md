## TODOS:
1. Use a headless browser like puppeteer or selenium to scrape the data instead of using a library like cheerio. This can help you take advantage of browser-level optimizations and may make your requests faster.

2. Optimize your code. Make sure you are only fetching the data you need, and that you are not making unnecessary requests.

3. Use a cache. If you are frequently scraping the same data, you can cache it and reuse it instead of fetching it again.

4. Use multi-threading and async programming. These techniques can help you fetch data from multiple stocks at the same time, which can speed up the process.

5. Use a scraping service or proxy rotation service, which allow you to scrape a large number of pages at the same time using a pool of IPs, thus avoiding IP bans, and increase speed.

6. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache and distribute your data globally, so that it's closer to your users and can be delivered faster.
